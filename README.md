# file_sorting_system
Hello there! I started learning python for few monthes and i have created file organizing system. An automation prograam to save your time and keep your folders organized, 
basically this programm will sort your directory in two ways:
1) in the first one, it will sort folder's file according to their extensions and
2) in the second one it will sort selected directory's folder's file in alphabetical order

I created this by using os and shutil pythonn modules and for GUI i used tkinter which is python freamwork for creating GUI
