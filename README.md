# 📂 File Sorting System (with Tkinter GUI)

This project is a **File Sorting System** built using **Python** and **Tkinter (GUI)**. It helps users organize files in a selected directory by:

🔹 **Level 1**: Sorting files by their **file extensions** in selected folder
🔹 **Level 2**: Sorting files inside folders in **alphabetical order** in selected folder and subfolders
🔹 **Level 3**: Combining both features in a **user-friendly GUI**

## 🎯 Features

✔️ Sort files in any folder by file extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.txt`)  
✔️ Alphabetically sort files in selected folders  
✔️ Tkinter-based GUI for easy navigation  
✔️ Works across Windows, Linux, and macOS  
✔️ Zero dependencies (built using built-in libraries only)

## 🧠 How It Works

### ✅ Level 1: Extension-Based Sorting
Organizes files like this:
```
📂 Sorted/
├── Images/
│   ├── img1.jpg
│   └── pic2.png
├── Documents/
│   ├── file.pdf
│   └── notes.docx
```



### ✅ Level 2: Alphabetical File Sorting
Renames and sorts files inside folders:



### ✅ Level 3: GUI Interface with Tkinter
Choose folders, run sorting, and see results — all through a simple graphical interface.
